	abstract = {Purpose: In an era of unprecedented student measurement and emphasis on data-driven educational decision making, the full potential for using data to target resources to students has yet to be realized. This study explores the utility of machine-learning techniques with large-scale administrative data to identify student dropout risk. Research Methods: Using longitudinal student records data from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, this article assesses modern prediction techniques, with a focus on tree-based classification methods and support vector machines. These methods incorporate 74 predictors measures from Grades 3 through 8, including academic achievement, behavioral indicators, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Findings: Two of the assessed classification algorithms predict high school graduation and dropping out correctly for more than 90\% of an out-of-sample student cohort. Findings reveal a shift toward lower dropout incidence in regions hit hardest by the economic recession of 2008, especially for male students. Implications for Research and Practice: Machine-learning procedures, as demonstrated in this study, offer promise for allowing administrators to reliably identify students at risk of dropping out of school so as to provide targeted, intensive programs at the lowest possible cost.},

	abstract = {The application of big data analytics in education is transforming learning, teaching and administration in schools. Current Education Data Mining ({EDM}) research focuses on teaching and personalized learning in higher institutions mostly in western countries with limited research conducted in African countries. Most research has been conducted using small datasets, simple learning analytics techniques and machine learning black box models to predict students’ performance. Black box modelling approaches use complex structures which are difﬁcult to be easily interpreted by stakeholders. We synthesize {EDM} approaches and tree based machine learning techniques to identify important features that can predict school performance across African countries such as South Africa. We apply {LightGBM} a gradient boosting framework and interpretable tree based algorithms on combined data sources from community surveys, school master lists and examination results to perform feature importance. The challenge faced in {EDM} research is limited education data sources, we merged different existing datasets from government reports and archives. We used community survey data to determine the standards of living in secondary schools within those communities. Cell phone internet, toilets, security, usable water sources, number of teachers and students, school location, and family head were identiﬁed as control variables impacting the attainment of schools. {LightGBM}, underlies the developed prediction model. It empowered the model with high accuracy, stability and easy interpretation hence outperforming {XGBoost}, decision tree and random forest algorithms.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that impact schools' academic performance and to explore their relationships through a two-stage analysis based on a sample of Tunisian secondary schools. In the first stage, we use the Directional Distance Function approach ({DDF}) to deal with undesirable outputs. The {DDF} is estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis method ({DEA}). In the second stage we apply machine-learning approaches (regression trees and random forests) to identify and visualize variables that are associated with a high school performance. The data is extracted from the Program for International Student Assessment ({PISA}) 2012 survey. The first stage analysis shows that almost 22\% of Tunisian schools are efficient and that they could improve their students’ educational performance by 15.6\% while using the same level of resources. Regression trees findings indicate that the most important factors associated with higher performance are school size, competition, class size, parental pressure and proportion of girls. Only, school location appears with no impact on school efficiency. Random forests algorithm outcomes display that proportion of girls at school and school size have the most powerful impact on the predictive accuracy of our model and hence could more influence school efficiency. The findings disclose also the high non-linearity of the relationships between these key factors and school performance and reveal the importance of modeling their interactions in influencing efficiency scores.},

	abstract = {Mass school closures have become commonplace in urban school districts. To explain their actions, school system leaders often rely on a dominant frame that presents closures as an inevitable, data-driven, and politically neutral phenomenon in an educational landscape defined by shrinking budgets, demographic changes, and increased school choice. In response, research has typically focused on how communities tell counternarratives that seek to interrupt official accounts of school closures. Using a critical frame analysis of qualitative data from the 2013 school closure process in Washington, {DC}, I discuss another grassroots approach to disrupting school closures: counterframes. Drawing on Critical Race Theory and social movement theory, I discuss counterframes as discursive arguments that allow communities to directly challenge official rhetoric and offer alternatives. Findings show that communities in {DC} crafted counterframes that pushed back on the notion that the closures were inevitable, questioned the data guiding the process, and attempted to expose hidden agendas and interests behind shuttering schools. The article concludes with the relevance of counterframes to broader educational mobilizations as well as their limitations.},

A central argument within this debate asserts that schools being closed are more likely to be located in minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and thus their abandonment has the potential for widening racial and socioeconomic gaps and exacerbating spatial inequality. Using school attendance boundary data in over 260 U.S. metropolitan areas, we examine the relationship between the locations of traditional elementary public school closures between 2010 and 2016 and neighborhood ethnoracial and socioeconomic composition in 2010 and their change over time. Our overall results indicate that closures are associated with lower neighborhood percent White and percent Hispanic and higher percent Black and socioeconomic disadvantage. While increasing percent White is positively associated with closure, we found little other evidence of a relationship between closure and other changes in ethnoracial and socioeconomic composition. However, the relationship between neighborhood context and closure varies across region and urbanicity, with closures associated with patterns of gentrification in urban areas, and exhibiting differential relationships with neighborhood {SES}, race and ethnicity across region.},

The results from our specifications validate the “official” rationale for closures and turnarounds: Low test scores are associated with closures and turnarounds under Mayor Daley, and underutilization is associated with closures under Mayor Emanuel. However, our findings also reveal some distance between technical-rational decision making and the realities of capital budgeting under austerity. The race of students and proximity to both the Central Business District and charter schools also predicted closures. This suggests multiple, potentially conflicting, interests that school districts balance to serve the needs of school-age populations and taxpayers and also the potential for burdening already vulnerable populations with the negative effects of disinvestment.},

School closings raise concerns about the possible negative impacts on student achievement, neighborhoods, families, and teaching staff. This study examines an anonymous urban district that, faced with declining enrollment, chose to make student achievement a major criterion in determining which schools would be closed. The district targeted low-performing schools in its closure plan, and sought to move their students to higher-performing schools. We estimate the impact of school closures on student test scores and attendance rates by comparing the growth of these measures among students differentially affected by the closures. We use residential assignment to school as an instrument to address non-random sorting of students into new schools. We also statistically control for the contemporaneous effects of other reforms within the district. Results show that students displaced by school closures can experience adverse effects on test scores and attendance, but these effects can be minimized when students move to schools that are higher-performing (in value-added terms). Moreover, the negative effect on attendance disappears after the ﬁrst year in the new school. Meanwhile, we ﬁnd no adverse effects on students in the schools that are receiving the transferring students.},

The achievement of students attending receiving-schools, however, was negatively affected by the receipt of displaced students. School absences increased significantly for displaced students following closure. We also find that the achievement of displaced and receiving-school students declined as the fraction of displaced students attending a receiving-school increased, and displaced students missed more days of school and received more suspension days the farther they traveled to their new school following closure.

This study provides a formal mediation analysis that decomposes the total effect of gentrification on children’s academic achievement into that which operates through residential displacement versus alternative pathways. This study finds that the effects of gentrification on children’s achievement patterns were concentrated amongst low-income children and were observed most strongly when gentrifiers were White. Low-income children exposed to gentrification saw declines in their academic performance trajectories, especially in math. These adverse effects were not found to be mediated by residential displacement.

As such, this study examines how leaders in a communityuniversity coalition in the Midwestern United States reopened a high school that was closed by its district. This case study draws on interviews and document data, and describes the forces that promoted school closure and its impacts on the community. Concepts from social capital and social network theories are used to guide the analysis. Findings indicate these leaders leveraged networks to negotiate a community-university social contract, took strategic and socially connected actions, and formed a community-driven education task force.

We estimate that the closures resulted in a near doubling of teacher exit among teachers in closed schools, particularly among low-performing teachers. We also find that, among closed-school teachers, Black teachers were more likely to return than White teachers.

We found that the effects of school closures on patterns of gentrification were concentrated among black neighborhoods. School closures increased the probability that the most segregated black neighborhoods experienced gentrification by 8 percentage points and increased the extent to which these neighborhoods experienced gentrification by .21 standard deviations. We found no evidence that school closures increased the likelihood or extent that white or Latinx neighborhoods experienced gentrification. Substantive conclusions were consistent across multiple measures of gentrification, alternative model specifications, and a variety of sample restrictions and were robust to a series of falsification tests. Results suggest school closures do not simply alter the educational landscape. School closures are also emblematic of a larger spatial and racial reimagining of U.S. cities that dispossesses and displaces black neighborhoods.},

Though these urban closures—and widespread community protests—have made headlines, rural schools have also long experienced and opposed the closure of their schools. A large body of research examines these urban and rural closures from a variety of perspectives, including their economic motivations and policy implications. This review reexamines this literature, looking across context to show how school closure can produce spatial injustice. Advocates argue that closures further academic opportunity, efficiency, and equality. But our analysis shows that closures are unevenly distributed, disproportionately affecting places where poor communities and communities of color live, and they can bring negative effects, harming students and adults and reducing their access to an important educational and community institution. We conclude with recommendations for research and practice.},

	abstract = {School closures can have enormous effects on students and families living in a neighborhood. School districts in many urban areas in the United States have recently been faced with the challenge of how to deal with a shrinking school-aged population, budget crises, aging facilities and poor academic performance. This has led some districts to close large numbers of school buildings. A prime example occurred in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2006. This research will examine changes in population count, racial composition, and housing characteristics in three affected neighborhoods of Pittsburgh following the decision by the Pittsburgh Board of Education to close 22 schools that year. The research will examine how large vacant facilities affect the neighborhood’s physical and social dynamics. Data analysis, interviews and site analysis help to answer the research questions. The findings suggest that school vacancies have a negative effect on neighborhoods to varying degrees, and the neighborhood’s ability to cope with this loss is determined by a number of factors such as desirability of the area and community resources. Recommendations can help other cities to better plan for closures in the future to ensure the most equitable outcomes.},

As a graduate student at the "Future Factory," Buolamwini's groundbreaking research revealed that {AI} systems-from leading tech companies-were consistently failing on non-male, non-white bodies. In Unmasking {AI}, Buolamwini goes beyond the news headlines about racism, colorism, and sexism in Big Tech to tell the remarkable story of how she uncovered what she calls "the coded gaze"-evidence of racial and gender bias in tech-and galvanized the movement to prevent {AI} harms by founding the Algorithmic Justice League. Applying an intersectional lens to both tech industry and research sector, Buolamwini shows how race, gender, and ability bias can overlap and render broad swaths of humanity vulnerable in our {AI}-dependent world.

	abstract = {When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.},

	abstract = {Predictive analytics methods in education are seeing widespread use and are producing increasingly accurate predictions of students’ outcomes. With the increased use of predictive analytics comes increasing concern about fairness for specific subgroups of the population. One approach that has been proposed to increase fairness is using demographic variables directly in models, as predictors. In this paper we explore issues of fairness in the use of demographic variables as predictors of long-term student outcomes, studying the arguments for and against this practice in the contexts where this literature has been published. We analyze arguments for the inclusion of demographic variables, specifically claims that this approach improves model performance and charges that excluding such variables amounts to a form of ‘color-blind’ racism. We also consider arguments against including demographic variables as predictors, including reduced actionability of predictions, risk of reinforcing bias, and limits of categorization. We then discuss how contextual factors of predictive models should influence case-specific decisions for the inclusion or exclusion of demographic variables and discuss the role of proxy variables. We conclude that, on balance, there are greater benefits to fairness if demographic variables are used to validate fairness rather than as predictors within models.},

With the prompt closure of schools across the world in response to this pandemic, school-going children and teenagers are ruptured both mentally and physically. Hence, {ML} has come across to be a reliable component to forecast the scenario effectively. A dataset from {UNESCO} is trained and tested by ten supervised {ML} algorithms. A comprehensive analysis among the predictive {ML} models was executed which bought satisfactory results with regard to accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, {ROC}-{AUC} by hyper parameter optimization. In this regard, grid search cross validation ({GridSearchCV}) was utilized in order to obtain the optimal parameters. However, the performance of Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) was also investigated and compared with the supervised {ML} models where {ANN} displayed maximum accuracy of 80.37\%. After rigorous comparative analysis, Decision Tree ({DT}) portrayed the highest accuracy of 90.75\%. Hence, it is evident that machine learning algorithm holds strong promise in forecasting the upcoming scenario of school closures due to Covid-19 and can contribute significantly in decision making for the welfare of the education system.},

We employ survival analysis using data from private, traditional public, and public charter schools in Milwaukee from 2005 to 2016. Data on enrollment trends, demographics, and academic performance from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction were combined with data from other sources on school safety and closure. Results from our models suggest: (a) enrollment losses drive school closure in all three sectors, (b) low academic achievement only predicts closure for private schools, (c) families choose schools based on academics in all three sectors, and (d) academics and school safety are positively correlated.},

We conducted a discrete-time survival analysis using life tables and binary logistic regression. Findings indicated that freestanding charter schools experience higher risks of closure than {EMO} and {CMO} managed charter schools in those counties. Although they are more likely to close, freestanding schools have higher student achievement in math and reading. Higher math proficiency reduces the likelihood of closure by 2.8\%.

The current study investigates the effects of school closing policies on student achievement by examining over 200 school closings in Michigan. Relative to the previous literature, the analysis uses a broader set of school closings to thoroughly investigate heterogeneity in treatment effects based on the performance level of the closed school. The results indicate that, on average, school closings in Michigan did no persistent harm to the achievement of displaced students. Moreover, students displaced from relatively low-performing schools experience achievement gains. The displacement of students and teachers creates modest negative spillover effects on the receiving schools, however. Hence, the closing of low-performing schools may generate some achievement gains for displaced students, but not without imposing spillover effects on a large number of students in receiving schools.},

	abstract = {Racial and socioeconomic stratification have long governed patterns of residential sorting in the American metropolis. However, recent expansions of school choice policies that allow parents to select schools outside their neighborhood raise questions as to whether this weakening of the neighborhood–school connection might influence the residential decisions of higher-socioeconomic-status white households looking to relocate to central city neighborhoods. This study examines whether and the extent to which expanded school choice facilitates the gentrification of disinvested, racially segregated urban communities. Drawing data from the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the National Center for Educational Statistics, and the Schools and Staffing Survey, this study finds evidence that college-educated white households are far more likely to gentrify communities of color when school choice options expand. In particular, the expansion of school choice increases the likelihood of gentrification by up to 22 percentage points in the most racially isolated neighborhoods of color—more than twice the baseline likelihood for such communities.},

This study evaluates the effectiveness of two well-known transformation methods: linear transformation and statistical standardization. These two are referred to as data standardization. A carefully designed experiment is used in which data from two-group classification problems were trained by feedforward networks. Different kinds of classification problems, from relatively simple to hard, were generated. Other experimental factors include network architecture, sample size, and sample proportion of group 1 members. Three performance measurements for the effect of data standardization are employed. The results suggest that networks trained on standardized data yield better results in general, but the advantage diminishes as network and sample size become large. In other words, neural networks exhibit a self-scaling capability. In addition, impact of data standardization on the performance of training algorithm in terms of computation time and number of iterations is evaluated. The results indicate that, overall, data standardization slows down training. Finally, these results are illustrated with a data set obtained from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.},

	abstract = {Due to its high prevalence and incidence, diabetes is considered significant public health. Since diabetes has no known cure, early diagnosis plays a vital role in effectively managing the disease. Feature scaling is a vital step in pre-processing data before building a model using machine learning. The datasets used for model training in machine learning often contain unpredictable values that may have varying scales. This can result in inequalities in comparing these values. Feature scaling techniques can address these challenges by adjusting the values and promoting easy and fair comparisons among values. This study aims to evaluate the impact of normalization, standardization, and no feature scaling on the performance of five machine learning models in diagnosing diabetes. The machine learning algorithms implemented for this study include random forest, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor ({KNN}), logistic regression, and support vector machine ({SVM}). These algorithms support supervised learning. Furthermore, several open-source frameworks and libraries were implemented. They include; Jupyter notebook, {SkLearn}, Pandas, {NumPy}, Matplotlib, and seaborn. The result obtained from the study indicates that the random forest model performed significantly well without implementing any feature scaling technique. This contrasts with the {KNN} and {SVM} model, which performed better when the normalization technique was implemented. Also, the naive Bayes model shows no changes when either standardization, normalization, or no feature scaling was implemented. This study concludes that not all model requires feature scaling techniques to be applied to the dataset to achieve optimal performance. Furthermore, distance-based and gradient descent algorithms previously thought to be sensitive to feature scaling may not necessarily be true, as indicated by the outcome of this study. Finally, feature scaling techniques significantly impact some models while others do not.},

	abstract = {Estimating relationships between multiple incomplete patient measurements requires methods to cope with missing values. Multiple imputation is one approach to address missing data by filling in plausible values for those that are missing. Multiple imputation procedures can be classified into two broad types: joint modeling ({JM}) and fully conditional specification ({FCS}). {JM} fits a multivariate distribution for the entire set of variables, but it may be complex to define and implement. {FCS} imputes missing data variable-by-variable from a set of conditional distributions. In many studies, {FCS} is easier to define and implement than {JM}, but it may be based on incompatible conditional models. Imputation methods based on multilevel modeling show improved operating characteristics when imputing longitudinal data, but they can be computationally intensive, especially when imputing multiple variables simultaneously. We review current {MI} methods for incomplete longitudinal data and their implementation on widely accessible software. Using simulated data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, we compare their performance for monotone and intermittent missing data patterns. Our simulations demonstrate that in a longitudinal study with a limited number of repeated observations and time-varying variables, {FCS}-Standard is a computationally efficient imputation method that is accurate and precise for univariate single-level and multilevel regression models. When the analyses comprise multivariate multilevel models, {FCS}-{LMM}-latent is a statistically valid procedure with overall more accurate estimates, but it requires more intensive computations. Imputation methods based on generalized linear multilevel models can lead to biased subject-level variance estimates when the statistical analyses involve hierarchical models.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionB}-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-{ALL}) presents unique diagnostic challenges due to its complex cellular makeup. Although flow cytometry, especially with {EuroFlow} standards, offers detailed insights, it is still a time-consuming process susceptible to variations between observers. The integration of machine learning ({ML}) can enhance this workflow, ensuring consistent and accurate diagnostic outcomes. This study examines how {ML} can be applied to flow cytometry data for identifying measurable residual disease ({MRD}) in B-{ALL}.{ObjectivesThe} objective of this project was to develop and validate a {ML} model for the accurate detection of {MRD} in B-{ALL} using standardized flow cytometry data from a real-world diagnostic unit in Spain.{MethodologyWe} collected 595 samples processed according to {EuroFlow} standards for {MRD} detection in B-{ALL}. These samples included two different antibody panels: the first panel targeted {CD}81, {CD}304+{CD}73, {CD}34, {CD}10, {CD}20, {CD}45, {CD}38, and {CD}19, while the second panel targeted {CD}81, {CD}66C+{CD}73, {CD}34, {CD}10, {CD}20, {CD}45, {CD}38, and {CD}19. All studies were conducted on follow-up samples analyzed for {MRD} detection or due to suspicion of relapse.Preprocessing involved using the Bioconductor package {flowAI} to remove doublets, margins, and artifacts. A gating strategy was then applied to enrich the analysis for B cells, focusing on extracting predominantly positive events from each sample. To address dataset imbalances, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique ({SMOTE}) in the training set.For clustering, we used {flowSOM} to extract clusters and metaclusters from each tube, which were subsequently fed into a random forest classifier. The model was trained and cross-validated on the training set, followed by independent validation on the test set.{ResultsThe} training set comprised 800 samples with a slightly unbalanced distribution of class labels (500 positive, 300 negative), due to the initial dataset lacking sufficient positive samples. The random forest model exhibited robust performance during the training phase, achieving an out-of-bag ({OOB}) area under the curve ({AUC}) of 99.44\%, a precision-recall ({PR}) {AUC} of 99.05\%, and a Brier score of 0.123 indicating high accuracy. The {OOB} G-mean was 0.96, with a misclassification rate of 3.12\%. The confusion matrix indicated a class error of 2.90\% for the negative class and 3.27\% for the positive class.The test set consisted of 92 samples. During the validation phase, the model maintained strong performance, with an {AUC} of 92.93\%, a {PR}-{AUC} of 0.92, and a Brier score of 0.08. The G-mean for the test set was 0.83, with a misclassification rate of 10.87\%. The confusion matrix for the test set showed a class error of 0\% for the negative class and 30.3\% for the positive class. Further analysis of the test set revealed that 56 samples were extracted due to suspicion of disease relapse, with a misclassification rate of 5\%, while 82 samples were obtained for {MRD} detection, where the rate increased to 13.58\%.In addition to the robust performance metrics, the implementation of our {ML} model within the {SmartCytoFlow} platform has significantly streamlined the diagnostic workflow. {SmartCytoFlow} automates data preprocessing, gating, clustering, and classification, providing real-time diagnostic support. The integration has resulted in a substantial reduction in analysis time and improved diagnostic consistency.{ConclusionOur} study highlights the effectiveness of integrating {ML} with flow cytometry for monitoring B-{ALL}. This approach complements traditional diagnostic methods, providing consistent and accurate results. Further validation in diverse cohorts is needed to establish its broader applicability in routine practice.},

Computational machine-learning ({ML}) methods add to population-level outcomes by helping determine generalizable predictive patterns and quantifying uncertainty in those estimates. The incorporation of uncertainty as well as predictions allows clinicians to assess the confidence level of the predictions, avoid over-reliance on potentially incorrect results, allows for risk management and mitigation by considering the potential range of outcomes. Thus, such models may permit better decision-making by considering different scenarios and their probabilities, and increase transparency and accountability, by providing insight into how the model arrived at its predictions. Our objective was to develop a personalized, predictive machine learning model derived from center for international bone marrow transplant research ({CIBMTR})datasets which meets acceptable {AUC}, calibration slope and discrimination.{MethodsWe} applied {ML} methods to clinical parameters and both categorical and time-to-event outcomes in a de-identified {CIBMTR} dataset of patients undergoing {HCT}. A supervised random forest model was created with baseline covariates as independent variables. Model selection was performed by both the clinician and data scientists to create a model using prognostically relevant variables. Since the number and percentage of negative outcomes in {HCT} for {SCD} is smaller than the positive outcomes, the model is imbalanced and biased towards predicting positive outcomes. To counter the imbalance, we constructed a training dataset taking each outcome variable of interest, and included randomly sampled positive outcomes, typically 1.5-3 times the total instances of the variable of interest. We ran the test dataset, and used a random forest on 20 such trials. To account for the effect of the undersampling, we propose a positive threshold δ, and assigned a final prediction of a negative outcome if the average sum for an element is greater than delta. We performed a 2 times Repeated 10 Fold Cross Validation, to demonstrate our model's versatility and response to unknown data. The accuracy score may be misleading as it may result from the model being able to correctly predict the numerical majority of the positive outcomes, and does not indicate the ability to detect negative outcomes. We therefore estimated balanced accuracy which is the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a higher balanced accuracy results only when both the negative and positive outcomes are predicted with a high accuracy. We also measured Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve ({ROC} {AUC}), a measure of the ability of a binary classifier to distinguish between classes. We define model confidence as the average probability across 20 trials, as well as our confidence in the model. We describe predictive probability percentage as : model confidence*our confidence in the model*100.{ResultsWe} examined de-identified records of 1641 patients who underwent {HCT} and were reported to the {CIBMTR}. Patients were followed for a median of 47.8 months (0.3-312.9) Patient characteristics included 73.4\% patient's age at {HCT} \&lt;18 years, Karnofsky-Lansky ({KPS}) score ≥ 90 in 74.7\%, overall survival 91.2\%, event-free survival 75.5\%, graft failure ({GF}) 17.9\%, {AGVHD} 18.3\%, and {CGVHD} 22.3\%. Predictive model performance is described in Table 1. Predictive variables that made a significant contribution, and predicted outcomes in three hypothetical scenarios are described in Figure 1. Overall, the predictive model provided acceptable {AUC}, Balanced accuracy, positive predictive value and sensitivity.{ConclusionsWe} report the development, testing, and validation of an {ML} model for individualized prediction of outcomes of {HCT} for {SCD}. The model provides acceptable {AUC}, accuracy, balanced accuracy, positive predictive value and sensitivity. This predictive model has the potential to aid clinicians in making shared decisions with their patients regarding {HCT} for {SCD}.},

Our comprehensive analysis of 2111 individuals' lifestyle and physical condition data yielded accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores that notably peaked in the third and fifth folds. The findings affirmed the significance of dietary habits and physical activity as substantial predictors of obesity levels. The variability in model performance across the folds underscored the importance of robust cross-validation in enhancing the model's generalizability. This research contributes to the burgeoning field of data science in public health by providing a viable model for obesity prediction and laying the groundwork for targeted health interventions. Our study's insights are pivotal for public health officials and policymakers, serving as a stepping stone towards more sophisticated, data-driven approaches to combating obesity. The study, however, recognizes the inherent limitations of self-reported data and the need for broader datasets that encompass more diverse variables. Future research directions include the analysis of longitudinal data to establish causal relationships and the comparison of various machine learning models to optimize predictive performance},

However, when the parametric model is misspecified, the obtained estimator might be severely biased and lead to erroneous conclusions. In this study, we propose a new estimation method for longitudinal data modeling using a mixed estimator in nonparametric regression. The objective of this study was to estimate the nonparametric regression curve for longitudinal data using two combined estimators: truncated spline and local linear. The weighted least square method with a two-stage estimation procedure was used to obtain the regression curve estimation of the proposed model. To account for within-subject correlations in the longitudinal data, a symmetric weight matrix was given in the regression curve estimation. The best model was determined by minimizing the generalized cross-validation value. Furthermore, an application to a longitudinal dataset of the poverty gap index in Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, was conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed mixed estimator. Compared to the single estimator, the truncated spline and local linear mixed estimator had better performance in longitudinal data modeling based on the {GCV} value. Additionally, the empirical results of the best model indicated that the proposed model could explain the data variation exceptionally well.},

	abstract = {Multiple metrics are used when assessing and validating the performance of quantitative structure–activity relationship ({QSAR}) models. In the case of binary classification, balanced accuracy is a metric to assess the global performance of such models. In contrast to accuracy, balanced accuracy does not depend on the respective prevalence of the two categories in the test set that is used to validate a {QSAR} classifier. As such, balanced accuracy is used to overcome the effect of imbalanced test sets on the model’s perceived accuracy. Matthews' correlation coefficient ({MCC}), an alternative global performance metric, is also known to mitigate the imbalance of the test set. However, in contrast to the balanced accuracy, {MCC} remains dependent on the respective prevalence of the predicted categories. For simplicity, the rest of this work is based on the positive prevalence. The {MCC} value may be underestimated at high or extremely low positive prevalence. It contributes to more challenging comparisons between experiments using test sets with different positive prevalences and may lead to incorrect interpretations. The concept of balanced metrics beyond balanced accuracy is, to the best of our knowledge, not yet described in the cheminformatic literature. Therefore, after describing the relevant literature, this manuscript will first formally define a confusion matrix, sensitivity and specificity and then present, with synthetic data, the danger of comparing performance metrics under nonconstant prevalence. Second, it will demonstrate that balanced accuracy is the performance metric accuracy calibrated to a test set with a positive prevalence of 50\% (i.e., balanced test set). This concept of balanced accuracy will then be extended to the {MCC} after showing its dependency on the positive prevalence. Applying the same concept to any other performance metric and widening it to the concept of calibrated metrics will then be briefly discussed. We will show that, like balanced accuracy, any balanced performance metric may be expressed as a function of the well-known values of sensitivity and specificity. Finally, a tale of two {MCCs} will exemplify the use of this concept of balanced {MCC} versus {MCC} with four use cases using synthetic data.},

	title = {Predictive Accuracy: A Misleading Performance Measure for Highly Imbalanced Data},
	abstract = {The most commonly reported model evaluation metric is the accuracy. This metric can be misleading when the data are imbalanced. In such cases, other evaluation metrics should be considered in addition to the accuracy. This study reviews alternative evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of a model in highly imbalanced data. We used credit card clients in Taiwan as a case study. The data set contains 30,000 instances (22.12\% risky and 77.88\% non-risky) assessing the likeliness of a customer defaulting on a payment. Three different techniques were used during the model building process. The first technique involved down-sampling the majority class in the training subset. The second used the original imbalanced data whereas prior probabilities were set to account for oversampling in the third technique. The same sets of predictive models were then built for each technique after which the evaluation metrics were computed. The results suggest that model evaluation metrics might reveal more about distribution of classes than they do about the actual performance of models when the data are imbalanced. Moreover, some of the predictive models were identified to be very sensitive to imbalance. The final decision in model selection should consider a combination of different measures instead of relying on one measure. To minimize imbalance-biased estimates of performance, we recommend reporting both the obtained metric values and the degree of imbalance in the data.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ``fit'' of models designed to predict binary outcomes has been a long-standing problem. We propose a flexible, portable, and intuitive metric for quantifying the change in accuracy between two predictive systems in the case of a binary outcome: the {InterModel} Vigorish ({IMV}). The {IMV} is based on an analogy to weighted coins, well-characterized physical systems with tractable probabilities. The {IMV} is always a statement about the change in fit relative to some baseline model---which can be as simple as the prevalence---whereas other metrics are stand-alone measures that need to be further manipulated to yield indices related to differences in fit across models. Moreover, the {IMV} is consistently interpretable independent of baseline prevalence. We contrast this metric with alternatives in numerous simulations. The {IMV} is more sensitive to estimation error than many alternatives and also shows distinctive sensitivity to prevalence. We then showcase its flexibility across examples spanning the social, biomedical, and physical sciences. We also demonstrate how it can be used to provide straightforward interpretation of logistic regression coefficients. The {IMV} allows for precise answers to questions about changes in model fit in a variety of settings in a manner that will be useful for furthering research with binary outcomes.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled {REML} criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or {REML} criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model.

Second, theoretical limits to predictive accuracy in complex social systems must be better characterized, thereby setting expectations for what can be predicted or explained. Third, predictive accuracy and interpretability must be recognized as complements, not substitutes, when evaluating explanations. Resolving these three issues will lead to better, more replicable, and more useful social science.},

	abstract = {Predictive analytics methods in education are seeing widespread use and are producing increasingly accurate predictions of students’ outcomes. With the increased use of predictive analytics comes increasing concern about fairness for specific subgroups of the population. One approach that has been proposed to increase fairness is using demographic variables directly in models, as predictors. In this paper we explore issues of fairness in the use of demographic variables as predictors of long-term student outcomes, studying the arguments for and against this practice in the contexts where this literature has been published. We analyze arguments for the inclusion of demographic variables, specifically claims that this approach improves model performance and charges that excluding such variables amounts to a form of ‘color-blind’ racism. We also consider arguments against including demographic variables as predictors, including reduced actionability of predictions, risk of reinforcing bias, and limits of categorization. We then discuss how contextual factors of predictive models should influence case-specific decisions for the inclusion or exclusion of demographic variables and discuss the role of proxy variables. We conclude that, on balance, there are greater benefits to fairness if demographic variables are used to validate fairness rather than as predictors within models.},
